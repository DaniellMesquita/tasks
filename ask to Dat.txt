does it downloads all versioned data while looking at versions when downloading a dat?

instead of creating new dat, load it from folder

if json haves a comma without following items, dat keeps site as "Untitled"

when clicking on version:preview and there are unpublished updates for dat.json, it shows the site isn't on disk
