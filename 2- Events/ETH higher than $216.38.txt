1) Start the trade
2) Send me an email asking me to sell you the ETH. This email MUST be the same as the Paypal email that will send the payment
3) I will reply to your email to confirm and I will fund the escrow at this point
4) Send the payment via Paypal as a friend or family. Use the same paypal address as in step 2. My paypal address is the same as my email address
5) After you have received the ETH, reply to the previous email and say that you have received the ETH and that you are satisfied with the trade
6) Then I will send you an email with the copy/paste log from LocalEthereum

PS: Step 5 is vital to this procedure. If you dont send me that email then I will not trade with you again and I will report you to Paypal AND LocalEthereum
