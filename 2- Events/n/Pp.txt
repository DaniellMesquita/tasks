Don't be that person: who lies to itself that doesn't needs help, reverberates that on other people and orders them to ask for help instead of you.



Asking "who is that", isn't being better; but showing how ignorant the questioner is.

When bad persons receives services from the good ones, they becames worse themselves; because only the good haves the creativity for evil the bad needs.

The evil isn't the ausence of good, but begins in desire of doing evil.
